# java_course_1
Java 1 course lectured by izv. prof. dr. sc. Marko Čupić, 2022

Everything provided in this repository is a part of either an exercise, homework or project that was organized as a faculty course by FER.

On this course, I learned many aspects of the Java programming language. The directory is made up of several tasks that are differentiated by the topic we were studying at the time. Using the build automation tool Apache Maven, using the unit testing framework JUnit, Java interfaces, Java generics, the Java Collections framework, files in Java, threads in Java, and Swing components were some of the highlights of this course. Learning how to properly document the code was a big part of the course, so all the code is provided with the documentation.
